Hello
Goodbye
I'm sorry
I love you
Keep out
Enter here
Restricted area
The end is near
Leave NOW
This is my space
Remove yourself
Remove yourself from my area
Please stop
Please don't do that
Don't do that
Don't look behind
Don't look inside
Don't open the box
Don't open the door
Hush
Oops
Beg
Why
Why does everything look the same
Outpost removed
Outpost destroyed
Abandon hope, all who enter
Reality fractures in these halls
He is destroying my home
They are destroying my home
You bring the doom to us all
Reality will shatter along with my home
You must stop him
I didn't expect you so soon
Wasn't there an outpost here?
You've been here before
You're going in circles
I've been here for days
It feels like I'm going in circles
You're not supposed to be here
You shouldn't have come here
We've been waiting for you
It goes on forever
It never ends
This place never ends
I don't remember coming this way before
Continue this way
You're not alone in here
The buzzing never stops
What is that buzzing?
This place is not meant for the living
Lost souls wander here forever
The walls have eyes and ears and elbows
The walls have secrets
I'm glad to see you're back
You don't want the seeker to win
I can't stop thinking about killing you
Would you like to see a magic trick?
Want to see a magic trick?
I tried to save you
I really tried
Do your best, it's not enough
Did something just move?
You're so close
Don't move
I see you
I'm watching
Smile, I'm watching you
I get so tired of watching you
I'm behind you
Something is watching us
I want my mommy
I crave a human name
The shadows hunger
Watch your step
Did you hear that too?
I hear something moving
I can hear your every step
Let me in
Let me out
The water is cold
SO COLD
I crave a human
One bite at a time
Who are you?
Are you ok?
They're here
It's alive
It's coming
It's near
Something is near
The darkness is alive
The time is near
It's only a matter of time
I put a spell on you
This place is cursed
There is no escape
You cannot escape
There's no way out
No one escapes alive
You will plead to escape
Sometimes dead is better
Even the dead tell stories
Dead people are here
Sacrifice them
Be afraid
Fear may save you
Feel free to scream
Do you want to play a game?
Wanna play?
You will die
You're doomed
At least your bones will survive
A little bit of torture goes a long way
May I pop your pimples?
Everything must go
Why am I violent
The skin is the best part
Spaghetti slide ahead
The gravy boat is full
Potato
The answer is potato
May I borrow your milk
Only 9 toes left
Jar of thumbs
Jar of eyeballs
I didn't do it
Sleep at your own risk
The exit is d...
The corners hide nightmares
How old is this place
