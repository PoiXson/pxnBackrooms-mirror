JUSTICE FOR FRANK
Hello
Goodbye
I'm sorry
I love you
You need to wake up
WAKE UP
KEEP OUT
DANGER
Don't go in
Don't go inside
Enter here
Restricted area
The end is near
Leave NOW
This is my space
Remove yourself
Remove yourself from my area
Please stop
Please don't do that
Please help me!
Don't do that
Don't look behind
Don't look inside
Don't open the box
Don't open the door
The portal is opening
Open the door
Don't open the door!
Don't do it
You don't belong here
Hush
Oops
Beg
Why
Why does everything look the same
Outpost removed
Outpost destroyed
Abandon hope, all who enter
Reality fractures in these halls
He is destroying my home
They are destroying my home
You bring the doom to us all
Reality will shatter along with my home
You must stop him
I didn't expect you so soon
Wasn't there an outpost here?
You've been here before
You're going in circles
I've been here for days
It feels like I'm going in circles
You're not supposed to be here
You shouldn't have come here
We've been waiting for you
It goes on forever
It never ends
This place never ends
I don't remember coming this way before
Do you remember?
Do you remember me?
Do you remember yet?
Did you forget?
Forgotten
I have been forgotten
You have been forgotten
Forget something?
Did you forget something?
Continue this way
You're not alone in here
The buzzing never stops
What is that buzzing?
The night is infinite
This place is not meant for the living
Lost souls wander here forever
Forgotten souls echo through the halls
The walls have eyes and ears and elbows
The walls have eyes, the floor listens
The walls have secrets
I'm glad to see you're back
You don't want the seeker to win
I can't stop thinking about killing you
I can taste you
Can I taste you?
You never have to think again
Would you like to see a magic trick?
Want to see a magic trick?
I tried to save you
I really tried
Do your best, it's not enough
Did something just move?
You're so close
Keep your eyes closed
Keep your eyes open
Don't move
I see you
I'm watching
I'm watching you
Smile, I'm watching you
I get so tired of watching you
I'm behind you
Something is watching us
There are things watching
You are AI
The AI is watching you
I want my mommy
I crave a human name
The shadows hunger
They hunt
Watch your step
Did you hear that too?
I hear something moving
I can hear your every step
Find it
Can you find it
You'll never find it
You'll never find my base
You'll never find answers
You must find answers!
You must find the answer!
Gone but not forgotten
Let me in
Let me out
Let me protect you
Let me help you
Let me kill you
Let me hold your hand
The water is cold
It's cold in me
SO COLD
I crave a human
One bite at a time
Who are you?
Who was in my room last night?
Who am I?
Are you ok?
They're here
It's alive
It's coming
It's near
Something is near
There's something here
The darkness is alive
The time is near
It's only a matter of time
I put a spell on you
This place is cursed
There is no escape
You cannot escape
There's no way out
No one escapes alive
You will plead to escape
Sometimes dead is better
Even the dead tell stories
Dead people are here
Sacrifice them
Be afraid
Fear may save you
Feel free to scream
Do you want to play a game?
Wanna play?
You will die
You will never leave
You're doomed
At least your bones will survive
A little bit of torture goes a long way
May I pop your pimples?
Everything must go
Why am I violent
The skin is the best part
Spaghetti slide ahead
The gravy boat is full
Potato
The answer is potato
The answer is egg
May I borrow your milk
I like chocolate milk
I like cereal
FRY-NIX
egg
EGG
Beaten like a yolk
Limitless glory of the egg
Limitless glory of yolk
Do you have eggs?
Would you like an egg?
Give your eggs to me
I need your eggs
You better get eggs
You will need eggs
Egg-sistential Dread
Beware of the egg
Beware of what walks in the dark
Only 11 toes left
Only 9 toes left
Only 8 toes left
Only 7 toes left
Only 6 toes left
Only 5 toes left
Only 4 toes left
Only 3 toes left
Only 2 toes left
Only 1 toe left
Jar of thumbs
Jar of eyeballs
I didn't do it
Sleep at your own risk
GO TO SLEEP
There is no exit
no eggs-it
The exit is d
The corners hide nightmares
How old is this place
There simply cannot be enough cheese
Echos fade, walls remember
Where shadows play hide and seek
Silent walls, endless paths
Silence speaks louder
Beyond the known, echoes dwell
Endless steps, nowhere ends
Whispers linger in forgotten halls
Where noise fades, echoes thrive
Whispers of the forgotten expanse
Footsteps fade, echoes endure
Don't forget to breathe
Walls watch, floors listen, darkness waits
The unknown whispers in your ear
Recover the body
Moist
Are we they?
I'll get you
I have a question for you
Unprotected Area!
I would love to go in the forest with you
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
I know where you live
I know your address
Cthulhu Rises!
Cluckthulu Rises!
